question: How do I use X with SvelteKit?

### How do I setup library X?

Please see [sveltejs/integrations](https://github.com/sveltejs/integrations#sveltekit) for examples of using many popular libraries like Tailwind, PostCSS, Firebase, GraphQL, mdsvex, and more.

### How do I use Babel, CoffeeScript, Less, PostCSS / SugarSS, Pug, scss/sass, Stylus, TypeScript, `global` styles, or replace?

Adding [svelte-preprocess](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-preprocess) to your [`svelte.config.cjs`](#configuration) is the first step. For many of the tools listed above, you only need to install the corresponding library such as `npm install -D sass`or `npm install -D less`. See the svelte-preprocess docs for full details.

Also see [the examples above](/faq#how-do-i-use-x-with-sveltekit-how-do-i-setup-library-x) of setting up these and similar libraries.

### How do I use a client-side only library that depends on `document` or `window`?

Vite will attempt to process all imported libraries and may fail when encountering a library that is not compatible with SSR. [This currently occurs even when SSR is disabled](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/754).

If you need access to the `document` or `window` variables or otherwise need it to run only on the client-side you can wrap it in a `browser` check:

```js
import { browser } from '$app/env';

if (browser) {
	// client-only code here
}
```

You can also run code in `onMount` if you'd like to run it after the component has been first rendered to the DOM:

```html
<script>
	import { onMount } from 'svelte';
	import { browser } from '$app/env';

	let awkward;

	onMount(async () => {
		if (browser) {
			const module = await import('some-browser-only-library');
			awkward = module.default;
		}
	});
</script>
```

### How do I setup a database?

Put the code to query your database in [endpoints](../docs#routing-endpoints) - don't query the database in .svelte files. You can create a `db.js` or similar that sets up a connection immediately and makes the client accessible throughout the app as a singleton. You can execute any one-time setup code in `hooks.js` and import your database helpers into any endpoint that needs them.

### How do I use Axios?

You probably don't need it. We'd generally recommend you just use `fetch` instead. If you insist, you're probably better off using the ESM drop-in replacement `redaxios` [until axios utilizes ESM](https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/1879). Finally, if you still want to use Axios itself, try putting it in `optimizeDeps.include`.

### Does it work with Yarn 2?

Sort of. The Plug'n'Play feature, aka 'pnp', is broken (it deviates from the Node module resolution algorithm, and [doesn't yet work with native JavaScript modules](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/638) which SvelteKit — along with an [increasing number of packages](https://blog.sindresorhus.com/get-ready-for-esm-aa53530b3f77) — uses). You can use `nodeLinker: 'node-modules'` in your [`.yarnrc.yml`](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc#nodeLinker) file to disable pnp, but it's probably easier to just use npm or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), which is similarly fast and efficient but without the compatibility headaches.
