### sveltekit:prefetch

SvelteKit uses code splitting to break your app into small chunks (one per route), ensuring fast startup times.

For _dynamic_ routes, such as our `src/routes/blog/[slug].svelte` example, that's not enough. In order to render the blog post, we need to fetch the data for it, and we can't do that until we know what `slug` is. In the worst case, that could cause lag as the browser waits for the data to come back from the server.

We can mitigate that by _prefetching_ the data. Adding a `sveltekit:prefetch` attribute to a link...

```html
<a sveltekit:prefetch href="blog/what-is-sveltekit">What is SvelteKit?</a>
```

...will cause SvelteKit to run the page's `load` function as soon as the user hovers over the link (on a desktop) or touches it (on mobile), rather than waiting for the `click` event to trigger navigation. Typically, this buys us an extra couple of hundred milliseconds, which is the difference between a user interface that feels laggy, and one that feels snappy.

Note that prefetching will not work if the [`router`](#ssr-and-javascript-router) setting is `false`.

You can also programmatically invoke `prefetch` from `$app/navigation`.

### sveltekit:noscroll

When navigating to internal links, SvelteKit mirrors the browser's default navigation behaviour: it will change the scroll position to 0,0 so that the user is at the very top left of the page (unless the link includes a `#hash`, in which case it will scroll to the element with a matching ID).

In certain cases, you may wish to disable this behaviour. Adding a `sveltekit:noscroll` attribute to a link...

```html
<a href="path" sveltekit:noscroll>Path</a>
```

...will prevent scrolling after the link is clicked.

### rel=external

By default, the SvelteKit runtime intercepts clicks on `<a>` elements and bypasses the normal browser navigation for relative (same-origin) URLs that match one of your page routes. We sometimes need to tell SvelteKit that certain links need to be handled by normal browser navigation.

Adding a `rel=external` attribute to a link...

```html
<a rel="external" href="path">Path</a>
```

...will trigger a browser navigation when the link is clicked.
